# 4.1 Introduction
## 4.1.1 Logical structure: linear and non-linear

**The logical structures reveal the logical relationships between data elements**. In arrays and linked lists, data are arranged in a specific sequence, demonstrating the linear relationship between data; while in trees, data are arranged hierarchically from the top down, showing the derived relationship between "ancestors" and "descendants"; and graphs are composed of nodes and edges, reflecting the intricate network relationship.

As shown in Following Figure, logical structures can be divided into two major categories: "linear" and "non-linear". Linear structures are more intuitive, indicating data is arranged linearly in logical relationships; non-linear structures, conversely, are arranged non-linearly.

- **Linear data structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables.
- **Non-linear data structures**: Trees, Heaps, Graphs, Hash Tables.
