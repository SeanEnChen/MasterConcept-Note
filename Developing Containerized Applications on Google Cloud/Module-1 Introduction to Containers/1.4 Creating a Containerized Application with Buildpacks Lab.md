## Overview

Buildpacks are another approach for building container images and provide an alternate approach to turn your source code into a container image. Buildpacks are distributed and executed in images called builders. Each builder can have one or more buildpacks. A builder turns your source code into a container image. The buildpacks do the actual work to build and package the container image that you can deploy to Cloud Run or run with Docker locally.

You can create your own buildpacks, or use those provided by multiple vendors. Google Cloud's buildpacks allow developers to create and deploy containerized applications without the need to install Docker locally, or create a Dockerfile. Buildpacks are also built into Cloud Run to enable a source-based deployment workflow.
## Objectives

In this lab, you:

- Build an application with `pack`, a command-line tool that is used with builders to create container images from source code.
- Use the Google Cloud's buildpacks builder to build a container image.
- Run and test the container locally with Docker.
- Build and redeploy the container to Cloud Run.
## Important Cloud Shell Command
### Configure your Cloud Shell environment

1. To set your project ID and region environment variables, in Cloud Shell, run the following commands:

```shell
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
REGION=us-central1
```

2. Set the compute region in Cloud Shell:

```shell
gcloud config set compute/region $REGION
```
### Enable Google APIs

- To use Cloud Run, and the Google Translate API later in this lab, enable relevant APIs for your project:

```shell
gcloud services enable artifactregistry.googleapis.com run.googleapis.com translate.googleapis.com
```
### Build the container

- To build the container, run `pack`:

```shell
pack build --builder=gcr.io/buildpacks/builder sample-py-app
```

A partial output is similar to:

```Text
...
...
[exporter] Setting default process type 'web'
[exporter] Saving sample-py-app...
[exporter] *** Images (9f9f9a48fd46):
[exporter]       sample-py-app
[exporter] Adding cache layer 'google.python.pip:pip'
[exporter] Adding cache layer 'google.python.pip:pipcache'
Successfully built image sample-py-app
```

> [!note]
> With _pack_, you did not need to write and provide a _Dockerfile_ to build the container image.

- To view the images downloaded and built in your Cloud Shell host, run:

```shell
docker images
```

```Text
REPOSITORY                  TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
gcr.io/buildpacks/builder   latest    514fb6f1bbfe   29 hours ago   804MB
gcr.io/buildpacks/gcp/run   v1        22db1b5e48e3   29 hours ago   177MB
buildpacksio/lifecycle      0.16.0    67e021546a3f   43 years ago   30.5MB
sample-py-app               latest    9f9f9a48fd46   43 years ago   571MB
```

- Run the container locally in Docker by passing in the PORT environment variable to the application and binding the host's port 8080 to the container port:

```shell
docker run -it -e PORT=8080 -p 8080:8080 -d sample-py-app
```
### Build and deploy the container

1. To build and deploy the container on Cloud Run, execute the following command:

```shell
gcloud run deploy sample-py-app --source . --region=${REGION} --allow-unauthenticated
```

2. When prompted, type **Y** to accept the default repository that is created in Artifact Registry to store the container image.
    
3. When the command completes, a Cloud Run service named `sample-py-app` is created.
    
The command output is similar to:

```Text
Building using Buildpacks and deploying container to Cloud Run service [sample-py-app] in project [qwiklabs-gcp-00-0d56d42aca1a] region [asia-east1]
OK Building and deploying new service... Done.

```
### Test the Cloud Run service

1. Set an environment variable for the Cloud Run service that was created in the previous step:

```shell
SERVICE_URL=[SERVICE URL]
```

2. To test the service, , and execute the `curl` command:

```shell
curl $SERVICE_URL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"text" : "Welcome to this sample app, built with Google Cloud buildpacks."}'
```

```Text
{"trtext":"Bienvenido a esta aplicaci\u00f3n de muestra, creada con paquetes de compilaci\u00f3n de Google Cloud."}
```
