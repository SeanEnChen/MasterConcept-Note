## Overview

[Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/overview) provides a single location for storing and managing your packages and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container images.

[Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/overview) is a service that executes your builds on Google Cloud.

[Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/overview/what-is-cloud-run) is a managed compute platform that lets you run containers on Google's scalable infrastructure.

[Google Cloud Observability](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations) provides integrated monitoring, logging, and tracing managed services for applications.

[Cloud Client Libraries](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/client-libraries-explained) are the recommended method for calling Google Cloud APIs from your applications. Cloud Client Libraries use the natural conventions and style of the programming language that you're using for your application. Cloud Client Libraries handle low-level communication with the server, including authentication and retry logic.

Google APIs use the [OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) protocol for authentication and authorization.

[Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/overview) lets you store API keys, passwords, certificates, and other sensitive data as binary blobs or text strings.

In this lab, you run a [Python](https://www.python.org/) application in Cloud Shell, and then deploy the application to Cloud Run. You work through issues that arise when the application is moved to Cloud Run, and explore application development features of Google Cloud's operations suite.

### What you will learn

In this lab, you learn to:

- Containerize and publish a Python web application to Artifact Registry.
- Deploy a containerized application to Cloud Run.
- Use logs to debug application issues.
- Add Error Reporting to an application.
## Important Cloud Shell Command
### Create the Firestore database

1. To create the [Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/) database, in Cloud Shell, run the following command: The Firestore database is used to store book and user profile data.

```shell
gcloud firestore databases create --location=region
```

2. If you're asked to authorize Cloud Shell, click **Authorize**.
### Create the Cloud Storage bucket with the correct permissions

1. To create the [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/) bucket, run the following command: The Cloud Storage bucket is used to store book cover images. The bucket has [uniform bucket level access](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/uniform-bucket-level-access) and does not use [public access prevention](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/public-access-prevention).

```shell
gcloud storage buckets create gs://project_id-covers --location=region --no-public-access-prevention --uniform-bucket-level-access
```

> [!note]
> If the command fails and the error indicates that the account does not have any valid credentials, try the command again. The permissions for the Qwiklabs student account might not have propagated yet.

2. To make all objects in the bucket publicly readable, run the following command:

```shell
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs://project_id-covers --member=allUsers --role=roles/storage.legacyObjectReader
```
### Store client secret JSON in Secret Manager

Secret Manager is a secure and recommended place to store the client secret JSON file.

1. To enable the Secret Manager API, run the following command:

```shell
gcloud services enable secretmanager.googleapis.com
```

2. To rename the client secret file, run the following command:

```shell
mv ~/client_secret*.json ~/client_secret.json
```  

3. To create the secret, run the following command:

```shell
gcloud secrets create bookshelf-client-secrets --data-file=$HOME/client_secret.json
```

There is now a secret named `bookshelf-client-secrets` that can be accessed from your application.

Another secret value that is needed for your application is the Flask secret key, which is used to sign information in cookies.

4. To create a secret for the Flask secret key, run the following command:

```shell
tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 </dev/urandom | head -c 20 | gcloud secrets create flask-secret-key --data-file=-
```

This command creates a random 20 character alphanumeric password, and then stores it in a secret named `flask-secret-key`.
### Copy the Python code to Cloud Shell

- To copy the Python code from a Cloud Storage bucket into the root directory, run the following command:

```shell
gcloud storage cp -r gs://cloud-training/devapps-foundations/code/lab2/bookshelf ~
```
### Create the repository

1. To create the [Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/overview) repository, in Cloud Shell, run the following command: The repository will hold our application container.

```shell
gcloud artifacts repositories create app-repo \
  --repository-format=docker \
  --location=region
```

2. To show the repository details, run the following command:

```shell
gcloud artifacts repositories describe app-repo \
  --location=region
```
### Build, containerize, and publish the application

You can create your own [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) to package your application into a Docker image, but [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/overview) can use [buildpacks](https://cloud.google.com/docs/buildpacks/overview) to build the container for you.

1. To build the application using Cloud Build, run the following command: The command builds the Docker image of the code in the `~/bookshelf` directory and stores it in the _app-repo_ repository in Artifact Registry.

```shell
gcloud builds submit \
  --pack image=region-docker.pkg.dev/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/app-repo/bookshelf \
  ~/bookshelf
```

2. To see the list of builds, run the following command: The _bookshelf_ build is listed.

```shell
gcloud builds list
```
### Deploy the app to Cloud Run

1. To deploy the application to [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/overview/what-is-cloud-run), run the following command:

```shell
gcloud run deploy bookshelf \
  --image=region-docker.pkg.dev/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/app-repo/bookshelf \
  --region=region --allow-unauthenticated \
  --update-env-vars=GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}
```

> [!note]
> The **EXTERNAL_HOST_URL** environment variable is no longer needed.

2. If you're asked to enable APIs, enter `y`.
	- The command deploys the image we just built to Cloud Run. We specify that unauthenticated calls are allowed because users only need to log in when they want to create, modify, or delete books. The `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable is provided to the application because it is not available in Cloud Run by default.
	- Cloud Run deploys the application.

> [!note]
> If you get an error indicating that run.googleapis.com cannot be accessed, the API enablement may not have propagated to Cloud Run yet. Repeat the Cloud Run command until it works.
### Create the service account and redeploy

1. To create a service account for the application, in Cloud Shell, run the following command:

```shell
gcloud iam service-accounts create bookshelf-run-sa
```

You haven't added any permissions yet. To determine the correct role to add, you can look at the [IAM basic and predefined roles reference](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles). The [Secret Manager roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#secret-manager-roles) include the _Secret Manager Secret Accessor_ role, which should provide the minimal permissions for accessing secrets.

> [!note]
> You can use an iterative process to figure out the permissions to add until the application runs correctly. For this lab, you will grant the required permissions to the service account without going through this process.

2. To add the required roles, run the following commands:

```shell
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT} \
  --member="serviceAccount:bookshelf-run-sa@${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT} \
  --member="serviceAccount:bookshelf-run-sa@${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/cloudtranslate.user"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT} \
  --member="serviceAccount:bookshelf-run-sa@${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/datastore.user"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT} \
  --member="serviceAccount:bookshelf-run-sa@${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/storage.objectUser"
```

The permissions are for the Secret Manager, the Cloud Translation API, Firestore, and Cloud Storage.

The running application will not immediately pick up the permissions, but it will within a few minutes. To avoid the delay, the app can be redeployed.

3. To redeploy the application with a service account, run the following command:

```shell
gcloud run deploy bookshelf \
  --image=region-docker.pkg.dev/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/app-repo/bookshelf \
  --region=region --allow-unauthenticated \
  --update-env-vars=GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT} \
  --service-account=bookshelf-run-sa@${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

4. To open the application, run the following command, and then click the link:

```shell
echo "https://bookshelf-$(gcloud projects describe $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT --format="value(projectNumber)").region.run.app"
```

- You may see an error. This error occurs because the permissions for the service account may have not yet propagated.
    
    If you look at the Bookshelf logs for the Cloud Run service, you should see a **Missing or insufficient permissions** error. The app will fail until the permissions are propagated and the service account can call the required Google Cloud services.
    
- Until the app successfully opens, close the application tab, and click the generated URL again.
    
    When the permissions have been propagated, the familiar **Books** page will be displayed.

### Add Error Reporting to the application

[Error Reporting](https://cloud.google.com/error-reporting/docs/grouping-errors) aggregates errors in your running cloud services.

1. To add the required role to the service account, in Cloud Shell, run the following command:

```shell
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT} \
  --member="serviceAccount:bookshelf-run-sa@${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/errorreporting.writer"
```

2. To build and redeploy the application, run the following commands:

```shell
gcloud builds submit \
  --pack image=region-docker.pkg.dev/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/app-repo/bookshelf \
  ~/bookshelf
gcloud run deploy bookshelf \
  --image=region-docker.pkg.dev/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/app-repo/bookshelf \
  --region=region --allow-unauthenticated \
  --update-env-vars=GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT} \
  --service-account=bookshelf-run-sa@${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```
