## Overview

[Cloud Client Libraries](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/client-libraries-explained) are the recommended method for calling Google Cloud APIs from your applications. Cloud Client Libraries use the natural conventions and style of the programming language that you're using for your application. Cloud Client Libraries handle low-level communication with the server, including authentication and retry logic.

[Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/) is a fast, fully managed, serverless, NoSQL document database built for automatic scaling, high performance, and ease of application development.

Google APIs use the [OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) protocol for authentication and authorization.

[Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/overview) lets you store API keys, passwords, certificates, and other sensitive data as binary blobs or text strings.

The [Cloud Translation API](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/overview) enables your websites and applications to dynamically translate text programmatically. Cloud Translation can translate text for more than 100 languages, and it can detect the language of source text.

In this lab, you update a [Python](https://www.python.org/) application that manages a list of books. You add the ability to log in to the application by using OAuth, and require the user to log in when adding, editing, or deleting books.

You also use the Cloud Translation API to translate the book descriptions into a different language. You add a user profile that stores the preferred language for the user.

### What you will learn

In this lab, you learn to:

- Create a simple Python [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) web application.
- Use Secret Manager to store sensitive application data.
- Use OAuth 2.0 to add user login to an application.
- Use the Cloud Translation API to detect the language of text and translate text.
## Important Cloud Shell Command

### Create the Firestore database

1. To create the [Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/) database, in Cloud Shell, run the following command: The Firestore database is used to store book and user profile data.

```shell
gcloud firestore databases create --location=region
```

2. If you're asked to authorize Cloud Shell, click **Authorize**.

### Create the Cloud Storage bucket with the correct permissions

1. To create the [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/) bucket, run the following command: The Cloud Storage bucket is used to store book cover images. The bucket has [uniform bucket level access](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/uniform-bucket-level-access) and does not use [public access prevention](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/public-access-prevention).

```shell
gcloud storage buckets create gs://project_id-covers --location=region --no-public-access-prevention --uniform-bucket-level-access
```

> [!note]
> If the command fails and the error indicates that the account does not have any valid credentials, try the command again. The permissions for the Qwiklabs student account might not have propagated yet.

2. To make all objects in the bucket publicly readable, run the following command:

```shell
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs://project_id-covers --member=allUsers --role=roles/storage.legacyObjectReader
```
### Copy the Python code to Cloud Shell

- To copy the Python code from a Cloud Storage bucket into the root directory, run the following command:

```shell
gcloud storage cp -r gs://cloud-training/devapps-foundations/code/lab2/bookshelf ~
```
### Store client secret JSON in Secret Manager

Secret Manager is a secure and recommended place to store the client secret JSON file.

1. To enable the Secret Manager API, run the following command:

```shell
gcloud services enable secretmanager.googleapis.com
```

2. To rename the client secret file, run the following command:

```shell
mv ~/client_secret*.json ~/client_secret.json
```  

3. To create the secret, run the following command:

```shell
gcloud secrets create bookshelf-client-secrets --data-file=$HOME/client_secret.json
```

There is now a secret named `bookshelf-client-secrets` that can be accessed from your application.

Another secret value that is needed for your application is the Flask secret key, which is used to sign information in cookies.

4. To create a secret for the Flask secret key, run the following command:

```shell
tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 </dev/urandom | head -c 20 | gcloud secrets create flask-secret-key --data-file=-
```

This command creates a random 20 character alphanumeric password, and then stores it in a secret named `flask-secret-key`.

## Important Flow

### Create functions for OAuth flow

In this task, you add functions that manage the OAuth login flow.

When a user logs in to the web application, the app will start the [OAuth authorization sequence](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#webserver). OAuth allows the user to authenticate and consent to access being requested by the application. The OAuth authorization sequence looks like this:

![OAuth authorization sequence](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/lKzqpeZZ%2FyaoXzYI2smACdEy2seWtJ48BZH2dCKFzz4%3D)

The authorization sequence begins when the application redirects the browser to a Google URL. Google handles the user authentication, session selection, and user consent. The result is an authorization code, which the application can exchange for an access token and a refresh token.

The application stores the refresh token for future use, and uses the access token to access Google APIs. The Bookshelf application calls a Google API to retrieve information about the user. When the access token expires, the application uses the refresh token to obtain a new access token.
