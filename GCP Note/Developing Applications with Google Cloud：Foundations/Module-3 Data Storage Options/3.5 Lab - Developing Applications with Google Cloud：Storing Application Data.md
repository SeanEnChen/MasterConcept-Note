## Overview

[Cloud Client Libraries](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/client-libraries-explained) are the recommended method for calling Google Cloud APIs from your applications. Cloud Client Libraries use the natural conventions and style of the programming language that you're using for your application. Cloud Client Libraries handle low-level communication with the server, including authentication and retry logic.

[Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/) is a fast, fully managed, serverless, NoSQL document database built for automatic scaling, high performance, and ease of application development.

[Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/) is a unified object storage that lets you serve, analyze, and archive data anywhere in the world.

In this lab, you create a [Python](https://www.python.org/) application that manages a list of books. You're able to add, edit, and delete books, collecting data like author, title, and description. The initial application stores the data in an in-memory Python dictionary, which causes all books to be lost when the application crashes.

You modify this application to store all the book data in Firestore, and then add the ability to store a cover image for a book, which you persist in Cloud Storage.

### What you will learn

In this lab, you learn to:

- Create a simple Python [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) web application.
- Create a Firestore database to store application data.
- Create a Cloud Storage bucket for storing images for use in the application.
