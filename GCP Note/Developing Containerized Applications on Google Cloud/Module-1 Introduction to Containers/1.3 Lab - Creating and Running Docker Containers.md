## Overview

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Docker helps you build, test, and deploy code faster, and it shortens the cycle between developing and running code. Docker does this by combining kernel containerization features with workflows and tooling that helps you manage and deploy your applications.

Docker lets you express the application build process by using a script, called a Dockerfile. Dockerfiles provide a low-level approach that offers flexibility at the cost of complexity. The Dockerfile is a manifest that details how to turn your source code into a container image.

Docker containers can be directly used in Cloud Run and Kubernetes, which allows them to be run on these platforms with ease. After learning the essentials of Docker, you will have the skill set to start developing containerized applications.
## Objectives

In this lab, you learn how to:

- Build, run, and debug Docker containers.
- Push Docker images to Artifact Registry, Google Cloud's container image repository.
- Pull Docker images from Artifact Registry.
## Important Cloud Shell Command
### Set up your environment

You execute the shell commands in this lab in a separate VM that has been pre-provisioned for the lab.

1. To start an SSH session on the VM, in **Cloud Shell**, execute the following command:

```shell
gcloud compute ssh lab-vm --zone=Zone
```

2. When prompted, type **Y** to continue.
    
3. For the passphrase, type **Enter** to not use any.
    
4. Type **Enter** again.
    
5. Grant permissions to the student user on the socket used by Docker:

```shell
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
```

6. To set your Project ID and region environment variables, run the following commands:

```shell
PROJECT_ID=Project
REGION=Region
```
### Build a container image

In this task, you create a Docker container image by using a Dockerfile.
#### Create a Dockerfile

1. Create a test directory and change to it:

```shell
mkdir test && cd test
```

2. Create the `Dockerfile`:

```shell
cat > Dockerfile <<EOF
# Use an official Node runtime as the parent image
FROM node:lts
# Set the working directory in the container to /app
WORKDIR /app
# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app
# Make the container's port 80 available to the outside world
EXPOSE 80
# Run app.js using node when the container launches
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
EOF
```

> [!note]
> In this step, you assemble the container image by first selecting a parent or base image.
> This is specified with the _FROM_ instruction and the official Docker image for Node version lts (long term support).
> 
> The _WORKDIR_ instruction sets the working directory in the container for any additional instructions that follow in the Dockerfile. For this lab, we use the /app directory as the container's working directory.
> 
> The _COPY_ instruction copies directories or files from the source location to the destination path of the container image file system. Here, we copy files from the current directory to /app.
> 
> The _EXPOSE_ instruction exposes the container's port so that it accepts connections on that port, which in this lab is port 80.
> 
> Finally, the _CMD_ instruction provides the node command to execute the application in the running container.
#### Build the container image

In this subtask, you build the container image from the Dockerfile by using the `docker build` command.

1. Run the `docker build` command:

```shell
docker build -t my-app:0.1 .
docker build -t my-app:0.2 . # rebuild
```

> [!note]
> This command builds the container image from the instructions in the Dockerfile in the current directory and tags the resulting image with the specified name and version. Google recommends to specify a tag to distinguish newer image versions from older ones.

2. View the list of images that were built:

```shell
docker images
```

> [!note]
> The command lists the base _node_ image and the _my-app_ image that you built. The size of the image is relatively small compared to other virtual machine images.
### Run and test the application

After the container image is successfully built, you can run your application and test it to ensure that it behaves as expected.
#### Run the container

1. To run the container, execute the command:

```shell
docker run -p 8080:80 --name my-app -d my-app:0.1
docker run -p 8080:80 --name my-app-2 -d my-app:0.2 # rebuild
```

> [!note]
> The _docker run_ command starts the container with the specified name. The -p argument maps the host's port 8080 to the container's port 80, enabling requests to reach the server at http://localhost:8080. The -d argument runs the container in the background.

2. To view a list of running containers, execute the command:

```shell
docker ps
```
### Test the application

1. To test the application, send it a HTTP request by using the `curl` command:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8080
curl http://localhost:8080?user=Learner # rebuild
```

2. Verify the application response:

```Text
Welcome to your first Docker container!
Learner, Welcome to your first Docker container! # rebuild
```

3. Stop the container by executing the `docker stop` command:

```shell
docker stop [CONTAINER ID]
```

Replace [CONTAINER ID] with the value of the CONTAINER ID from the output of the command that was executed in the previous subtask.

### Troubleshooting

There are some easy techniques to troubleshoot your containerized applications. We review some of these methods in this task.
#### View container logs

1. First, retrieve the ID of the container whose logs you need to view:

```shell
docker ps
```

2. To view the container logs, run the `docker logs` command:

```shell
docker logs [CONTAINER ID]
```

Replace the CONTAINER ID with the initial characters of the container ID that uniquely identifies it from the output of the previous command. To tail the log's output as the container is running, use the -f option with the _logs_ command.

```Text
Server running at http://0.0.0.0:80/
Received request with URL: ?/?user=Learner
```
#### Start a shell inside the container

You can start an interactive shell inside a running container to troubleshoot it.

1. To start an interactive `Bash` session, run:

```shell
docker exec -it [CONTAINER ID] bash

# show in Cloud Shell
root@7071749fe0f6:/app#
```
#### Examine container metadata

1. To view a container's metadata, run:

```shell
docker inspect [CONTAINER ID]
```

Here's a partial output from the command:

```Text
[
 {
   "Id": "7071749fe0f66b8b1953bbb6f28f159bd5dbeae079595675e2591d32d87ae5dc",

   ...
 }
]
```


> [!note]
> By default, the _inspect_ command provides detailed metadata information in a JSON array. You can filter the results with the _--format_ argument to inspect specific fields in the output.

### Authenticate Docker to use the repository

Before you can push or pull images to or from the repository, you must configure Docker to authenticate requests to the repository in Artifact Registry.

1. To set up authentication to Docker repositories in the region `Region`, in the VM shell, run the following command:

```shell
gcloud auth configure-docker ${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev
```

2. When prompted, type **Y**.

The full name of the repository that you created is: `Region`-docker.pkg.dev/`Project-ID`/my-repo. Docker image repository names use the format: _[location]-docker.pkg.dev_ in Artifact Registry.
### Push the container to Artifact Registry

1. To push a container image to your private registry hosted by Artifact Registry, you need to first tag the image with the repository name:

```shell
docker build -t ${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/my-repo/my-app:0.2 .
```

2. List the Docker images that you built:

```shell
docker images
```

3. To push the image to Artifact Registry, run the following command:

```shell
docker push ${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/my-repo/my-app:0.2
```

The output of this command is similar to:

```Text
The push refers to repository [east1-docker.pkg.dev/qwiklabs-gcp-02-7c092125ce3a/my-repo/my-app]
b29bce04ddbb: Pushed

```
### Stop and remove containers

1. To stop all running containers, execute the following command:

```shell
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
```

2. To remove all containers, execute the following command:

```shell
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
```
### Remove all container images

1. To remove the registry-tagged container image, execute the following command:

```shell
docker rmi ${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/my-repo/my-app:0.2
```

> [!note]
> This command does not remove the container image from the registry.

2. To remove all other images, execute the following command:

```shell
docker rmi -f $(docker images -aq)
```

You should now have a fresh host environment without any local images.
### Test the image

Test the image by pulling it from Artifact Registry.

1. To pull the image from Artifact Registry, execute the following command:

```shell
docker pull ${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/my-repo/my-app:0.2
```

2. To list the image, execute the following command:

```shell
docker images
```

3. To run the container, execute the following command:

```shell
docker run -p 8080:80 -d ${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/my-repo/my-app:0.2
```

4. To test the application, run:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8080?user=Learner
```

> [!note]
> This task demonstrates container portability where you can run containerized applications on other VMs or environments with Docker, and without the need to install any application dependencies on the host machine. The container images can be hosted on public or private registries which should be accessible by Docker.
