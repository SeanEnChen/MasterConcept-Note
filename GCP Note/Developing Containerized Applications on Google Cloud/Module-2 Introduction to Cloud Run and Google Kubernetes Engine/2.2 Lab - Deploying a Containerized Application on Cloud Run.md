## Overview

[Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) is a fully managed compute platform that allows you to run stateless containers that are invocable with HTTP requests. You can deploy code written in any programming language on Cloud Run if you can build a container image from it. You can use the source-based deployment option that builds the container for you when developing your application in Go, Node.js, Python, Java, .NET Core, or Ruby.

Cloud Run is serverless, and runs your containers on Google's scalable infrastructure. It's built on Knative, and lets you choose to run your containers either fully managed with Cloud Run, or in your Google Kubernetes Engine cluster with Cloud Run on GKE.

Cloud Run works well with other services on Google Cloud, so you can build full-featured applications without spending too much time operating, configuring, and scaling your Cloud Run service.
## Objectives

In this lab, you:

- Use Cloud Build to create a Docker container image for your application.
- Deploy the container image to Cloud Run.
- Run and test the containerized application.

## Important Cloud Shell Command
### Configure your project and environment

1. Sign in to the Google Cloud console with your lab credentials, and open the **Cloud Shell** terminal window.
2. To set your project ID and region environment variables, in Cloud Shell, run the following commands:

```shell
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
REGION=Region
```

3. To enable relevant APIs, run the following command:

```shell
gcloud services enable artifactregistry.googleapis.com \
cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
run.googleapis.com
```
### Authenticate Docker to use the repository

Before you can push images to the repository, you must configure Docker to authenticate requests to the repository in Artifact Registry.

1. To set up authentication to Docker repositories in the region `Region`, in Cloud Shell, run the following command:

```shell
gcloud auth configure-docker ${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev
```

2. When prompted, type **Y**.
### Create the build configuration file

To provide instructions to Cloud Build, you create a build configuration file that contains a set of tasks. These instructions can configure builds to fetch dependencies, run unit and integration tests, perform static analysis, and create artifacts with builders like docker, gradle, maven, and others.

1. Set an environment variable for the repository name:

```shell
REPO=${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/my-repo
```

2. Create the build configuration file:

```shell
cat > cloudbuild.yaml <<EOF
steps:
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  args: [ 'build', '-t', '${REPO}/sample-node-app-image', '.' ]
images:
- '${REPO}/sample-node-app-image'
EOF
```
### Build the container

1. To build the container with **Cloud Build**, execute the following command:

```shell
gcloud builds submit --region=$REGION --config=cloudbuild.yaml
```

Here's similar (partial) output from the command:

```
### Deploy the container to Cloud Run

With the container image built, you can now deploy it to Cloud Run. There are two approaches for deploying to Cloud Run:

- [Managed Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run): A fully managed service model where the entire container lifecycle is managed by Cloud Run. You use this approach in this lab.

- [Cloud Run on Anthos](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/gke/setup): Cloud Run with an extra layer of control, which lets you bring your own clusters and pods from GKE.

In this task, you deploy your container image to the fully managed Cloud Run service on Google Cloud.

1. To deploy the container image, in Cloud Shell, execute the following command:

```shell
gcloud run deploy sample-node-app --image ${REPO}/sample-node-app-image --region $REGION --allow-unauthenticated
```

2. After the command completes, in the Google Cloud console, in the navigation menu (![navigation menu](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/UAxF0Fb1h7wI2YrXKdhH0PtWrnMia4tZTOwRGmvEwTs%3D)) click **Cloud Run**.

3. To display the details of the Cloud Run service, click the **sample-node-app** service name.
### Test the application on Cloud Run

1. To verify that the service is running, and available to accept requests, in Cloud Shell, execute the following command:

```shell
gcloud run services list
```

The output of the command is similar to:

```Text
✔
SERVICE: sample-node-app
REGION: asia-east1
URL: https://sample-node-app-dduno3adrq-uc.a.run.app
LAST DEPLOYED BY: student-04-329a97f025fd@qwiklabs.net
LAST DEPLOYED AT: 2023-02-28T22:21:04.803928Z
```

2. From the command output, copy the value of the URL, and paste it in the curl command appending `service/products` to the end of the URL as shown. Pipe the output to the `jq` command, and press ENTER:

```Shell
curl https://sample-node-app-dduno3adrq-uc.a.run.app/service/products | jq
```
