## Overview

The principle of least privilege states that a resource should only have access to the exact set of resources it needs in order to function. For example, if a service is performing an automated database backup, the service should be restricted to read-only permissions on exactly one database. Similarly, if a service is only responsible for encrypting data, it should not have permissions for decrypting data.

In Cloud Run, if a service is deployed without specifying a service account, a default service account is used. The default service account used is the Compute Engine service account which has the broad Editor role on the project. Because of policy binding inheritance, this service account has read and write permissions on most resources in your project. While convenient, it's an inherent security risk as resources can be created, modified, or deleted with this service account.

To mitigate this risk and implement the principle of least privilege, you should create a service account that serves as the service's identity, and grant the minimum set of permissions to the account that are required for the service's functionality.
### Objectives

In this lab, you learn to:

- Configure your environment and enable the Cloud Run API.
- Create and deploy a public Cloud Run service.
- Test the service with unauthenticated requests.
- Create a service account with minimum permissions.
- Use the gcloud CLI to authenticate with the service account, and invoke a Cloud Run service.
- Implement least privilege by granting the minimum set of permissions required to invoke a service on Cloud Run.
### Prerequisites

These labs are based on intermediate knowledge of Google Cloud. While the steps required are covered in the content, it would be helpful to have familiarity with any of the following products:

- IAM
- Cloud Run
## Important Cloud Shell Command
### Configure the environment

Set up environment variables in Cloud Shell to make the provisioning process more flexible.

1. Enable Cloud Run API:

```shell
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com
```

2. Create a LOCATION environment variable:

```shell
LOCATION=REGION
```

3. Set the default Cloud Run region:

```shell
gcloud config set run/region $LOCATION
```

### Create and deploy a public service
#### Requirements

Quickway parking has a Cloud Run billing service that they would like to be made more secure. In this task, you:

- Deploy the _billing service_ from an image.
- Test the service by invoking it without any authentication.
#### Deploying with Cloud Run

The Quickway development team already has an image of the billing application available on Google Cloud.

1. Deploy the billing application image to Cloud Run:

```shell
gcloud run deploy billing-service \
  --image gcr.io/qwiklabs-resources/gsp723-parking-service \
  --region $LOCATION \
  --allow-unauthenticated
```

2. Assign the URL of the new service to an environment variable:

```shell
BILLING_SERVICE_URL=$(gcloud run services list \
  --format='value(URL)' \
  --filter="billing-service")
```

3. Invoke the service without any authorization:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BILLING_SERVICE_URL -d '{"userid": "1234", "minBalance": 100}'
```

The service does not generate any output when invoked.

Take a closer look at the authentication applied. Currently **anyone on the internet** can call the billing service. This is indicated by the _allUsers_ identity that has the _Cloud Run Invoker_ role.

![The Quickway Parking diagram, where the billing service is publicly accessible.](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/CNkReuIBTgGVaKD%2BM122xGsS2YV3%2FqgqI0HIXC1D0lI%3D)

When the Billing service was originally deployed, it used the `--allow-unauthenticated` permission, which means that the service is publicly accessible, and can be invoked without any authentication.

|Type|Permission|Description|
|---|---|---|
|URL Access|`--allow-unauthenticated`|Make the service publicly accessible (Unauthenticated users can access it).|
|Invoking Principal|allUsers|Allow the service to be invoked/triggered by anyone.|

By removing the `--allow-unauthenticated` permission you can use the Cloud Run default permissions to secure the service, or you can explicitly specify the `no-allow-unauthenticated` permission.

|Type|Permission|Description|
|---|---|---|
|URL Access|`--no-allow-unauthenticated`|Secure the service with authentication (Only authenticated users can access it).|
|Invoking Principal|none|Do not allow the service to be invoked/triggered by anyone.|

> [!note]
> Remember, with Google Cloud, always try to use least privilege permissions in your solution.

By making these changes, the Security team will be a lot happier with the overall design.
### Authenticating service requests

The team updates the application design to show how the changes will work:

![The Quickway Parking diagram, where the billing service requires authentication.](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/FFuMJaAdBZYxJiHlSGiyV71yhYvDOeIMtXO5DIRcNG0%3D)

The main changes are:

- Remove unauthenticated public access to the _billing service_.
- Create a new service account with appropriate permissions to invoke the _billing service_.

#### Update the service to require authentication

Now that you understand more about the permissions used with Cloud Run, correct the authentication permissions applied to the Billing service:

1. Delete the existing deployed service:

```shell
gcloud run services delete billing-service
```

2. If prompted, type **Y**, and then press **Enter**.

3. Redeploy the _billing service_ with the `--no-allow-authenticated` permission:

```shell
gcloud run deploy billing-service \
  --image gcr.io/qwiklabs-resources/gsp723-parking-service \
  --region $LOCATION \
  --no-allow-unauthenticated
```

Redeploying the service means it no longer allows unauthenticated access at its service URL. In addition, the access permission to invoke the service has been removed.

4. Wait a few seconds, and then invoke the _billing service_ again as before:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BILLING_SERVICE_URL -d '{"userid": "1234", "minBalance": 100}'
```

As expected, the output is a permissions error since the service now requires authentication.
### Invoke the service with authentication

Now that you have a service account with the appropriate permission, you can use it to invoke your Cloud Run service.
#### Authenticate with gcloud

The first step is to set the service account in gcloud so it can be used to authenticate with the service.

1. In the Cloud Shell terminal menu, open a new shell in a separate tab by clicking **Add** (![add](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/Ku8WDO0HmyEnieuJFNYyzbvTz2VUPldrUYH2ORP6XYk%3D)).

Execute the remaining commands of this task in this Cloud Shell window.

2. Get the service account identity email and save it in an environment variable:

```shell
BILLING_INITIATOR_EMAIL=$(gcloud iam service-accounts list --filter="Billing Initiator" --format="value(EMAIL)"); echo $BILLING_INITIATOR_EMAIL
```

3. In this Cloud Shell terminal, assign the URL of the _billing service_ to an environment variable:

```shell
BILLING_SERVICE_URL=$(gcloud run services list \
  --format='value(URL)' \
  --filter="billing-service")
```

4. To authenticate gcloud using the service account, generate a key file:

```shell
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json --iam-account=${BILLING_INITIATOR_EMAIL}
```

5. Authorize access to Cloud Run with a service account:

```shell
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=key.json
```

#### Invoke the service

1. Invoke the Cloud Run _billing service_ with an identity token generated from the service account:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" \
  $BILLING_SERVICE_URL -d '{"userid": "1234", "minBalance": 500}'

```

2. In the Google Cloud console **Navigation menu** (![navmenu](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/tkgw1TDgj4Q%2BYKQUW4jUFd0O5OEKlUMBRYbhlCrF0WY%3D)), click **Cloud Run**.
    
3. Click the link to the _billing-service_.
    
4. To view the service logs, click **Logs**.
    
5. Add the log filter `minBalance` to view the updated minimum balance received in the request made to the service.

### Implement least privilege

You've used a service account with the appropriate permissions to invoke a Cloud Run service that was previously accessible by anyone. But, have you used the absolute minimum privileges needed to call this specific service?

To determine if this is true, deploy a second billing service which we will assume should be accessible only by other internal private services, such as Cloud Scheduler.

Here's a diagram of this requirement:

![Requirement diagram showing access to a second internal billing service.](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/XjqZiYDWe1PDhnQSuHLLLQgH7DLK%2BR5ZWXX381c34Lk%3D)

#### Deploy a second service

1. Open a third Cloud Shell terminal window or tab.
    
2. Create a LOCATION environment variable:
    
```shell
LOCATION=REGION
```
    
3. To simulate a second service, deploy the billing application image to Cloud Run:
    
```shell
gcloud run deploy billing-service-2 \
  --image gcr.io/qwiklabs-resources/gsp723-parking-service \
  --region $LOCATION \
  --no-allow-unauthenticated
```
    
4. Assign the URL of the new service to an environment variable:

```shell
BILLING_SERVICE_2_URL=$(gcloud run services list \
  --format='value(URL)' \
  --filter="billing-service-2")
```

#### Invoke the second service with the service account identity

1. In this third Cloud Shell terminal, authorize access to Cloud Run with the same service account:
    
```shell
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=key.json
```
    
2. Invoke the second Cloud Run service with an identity token generated from the service account:
    
```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" \
  $BILLING_SERVICE_2_URL -d '{"userid": "1234", "minBalance": 900}'
```
    

Why was this successful!? It's because when you created the service account, the Cloud Run Invoker permissions were granted to this account on the project. Because of inheritance, resources in the project such as the two Cloud Run services inherit those permissions, and as a result, the service account can be used to invoke the services.

#### Restrict service account permissions

To fully implement least privilege, the service account should only be granted permissions on the service that it needs.

In this subtask, you remove the permission previously granted to the service account on the project, and then add the appropriate permissions required to invoke the original billing service.

1. Switch to the first Cloud Shell terminal window.
    
2. In this Cloud Shell terminal, get the service account identity email and save it in an environment variable:
    
```shell
BILLING_INITIATOR_EMAIL=$(gcloud iam service-accounts list --filter="Billing Initiator" --format="value(EMAIL)"); echo $BILLING_INITIATOR_EMAIL
```
    
3. Remove the permission on the service account for the project:
    
```shell
gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT \
  --member=serviceAccount:${BILLING_INITIATOR_EMAIL} \
  --role=roles/run.invoker
```
    
4. Add the permission to the service account on the _billing service_:
    
```shell
gcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding billing-service --region $LOCATION \
  --member=serviceAccount:${BILLING_INITIATOR_EMAIL} \
  --role=roles/run.invoker --platform managed
```
#### Invoke the services

1. Switch back to the second Cloud Shell terminal window or tab.
    
2. Wait a few seconds, and then invoke the first Cloud Run _billing service_ with an identity token generated from the service account:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" \
  $BILLING_SERVICE_URL -d '{"userid": "1234", "minBalance": 700}'
```

It takes a few seconds for the updated permissions to propagate, after which this invocation should be successful.

1. Switch to the third Cloud Shell terminal window.
    
2. Try to invoke the second Cloud Run service with an identity token generated from the same service account:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" \
  $BILLING_SERVICE_2_URL -d '{"userid": "1234", "minBalance": 500}'
```

You should now receive a permissions error indicating that the service account has only the minimum set of permissions required to invoke the first service.
